        `The purpose of our Information Security is to restrict access to confidential and sensitive data and to protect it from being lost or compromised regardless of whether these are held in manual or electronic form. This will help to safeguard the reputation of the Truthware, to optimize the management of risk and to minimize the impact of Information Security incidents. Implementation of this Policy will provide assurance to stakeholders, partners and data subjects, that their information is held securely and used appropriately by the Truthware, whilst complying with the Nigerian Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) and satisfying auditors.`,

      title: "POLICY DEFINITION",
      paragraphs: [
        `According to the NDPR, anyone involved in data processing or the control of data shall develop security measures to protect data. These measures will include ensuring that information is only available to those that are authorized to gain access, safe guarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods, and assurance that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when this is required.`,
        `Information takes many forms. It may be processed and stored on computers or in other electronic form, printed or written on paper, shared through voice or video communications, transmitted through post or electronic means such as e-mail or fax, made available on corporate videos or web sites. Whatever form the information may take, or means by which it is shared, stored or processed, it should always be appropriately classified and protected according to that classification.`,
        `Information systems, the information processed and stored are vital assets to Truthware. Any loss of computer systems or the information they contain could have serious repercussions for Truthware and/or its clients. A breach of security during processing, storage or transfer of data could result in financial loss, personal injury to a member of staff, or client, serious inconvenience, embarrassment, or even legal proceedings against Truthware, and possibly the individuals involved. In order to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of these systems an appropriate level of security must be achieved and maintained. The level of security implemented on each of the various systems will be consistent with the designated security classification of the information and the environment in which it operates.`,
        `Information on computer systems will be protected with anti-virus software, which will be updated regularly. Scans will be carried out regularly on all servers, workstations and laptops, and virus definitions will be updated each weekday. Updates and scans will be automatic for every machine and must not be turned off or bypassed.`,
        `Truthware shall take appropriate steps to prevent, detect, and recover from any loss or incident, whether accidental or malicious, including error, fraud, misuse, damage and disruption to, or loss of computing or communications facilities.`,
        `A security risk assessment is carried out on each information asset to identify the level of protection required. The security and control procedures required will take into account the sensitivity and value of the information.`
